Nice, got you now – you want to build **your own TorlyAI-killer** 😈

Here are **10 advanced, “PhD-level” features** you can build into your Innovator-Visa platform that the others *typically* don’t offer (at least not in this integrated, explicit way):

---

### 1. Live “Rule Change” Engine (Home Office Diff Tracker)

An engine that **monitors official guidance & Immigration Rules**, compares new versions to old ones, and visually highlights *exact changes* that impact Innovator Founder applicants (e.g. wording shifts around “innovative”, job creation, funding evidence).
Founders see a **“You are affected / not affected”** banner plus a human-readable summary, instead of trying to read 60-page PDFs.

---

### 2. Endorser Behaviour Simulator (What-If Endorsement Scoring)

A feature that models each **endorsing body as a slightly different “persona”** with different risk appetites and sector preferences.
The user can run **“What if UKES reviews this?” vs “What if Envestors reviews this?”**, seeing scenario-based feedback on how the same idea scores, and which parts need adaptation per endorser.

---

### 3. Evidence Graph & Gap Map (Claim-to-Proof Engine)

Every claim in the business plan (“we have traction”, “we’re innovative”, “we can create X jobs”) is **linked to specific evidence**: screenshots, contracts, analytics, GitHub repos, testimonials.
Your system builds a **visual knowledge graph** showing well-supported claims vs “red zones” with weak evidence, and auto-suggests what to collect (e.g. pilot LOI, user survey, early invoices).

### 4. “Traction Forecast” Simulator Using Comparable Startups

Using sector + business model, your tool matches the user’s idea to **comparable UK / EU startups** (by stage, team, model) and generates a **realistic traction envelope** – what kind of users/revenue/employment is believable in year 1–3.
This helps applicants avoid **over-optimistic hockey-stick charts** and instead present **data-anchored** projections.

---

### 5. Multi-Route Strategy Planner (Not Just Innovator)

Your platform doesn’t only say “Innovator yes/no”; it **compares routes**:

* Innovator Founder vs
* Skilled Worker (sponsorship) vs
* Global Talent vs
* Start-Up style incubator / accelerator.
  It then outputs a **strategy tree**: e.g. “Short-term: Skilled Worker; Medium-term: Innovator with spin-out; Risk profile: X.”

---

### 6. Team & Skills Gap Modeller (Visa-Aligned HR Plan)

Instead of generic “we will hire 5 people”, your tool models:

* Skills already in the founding team
* Skills missing vs business model
* **Job roles mapped to UK SOC codes** and salary bands.
  The output is a **skills roadmap** + hiring plan that makes job-creation claims concrete and aligned with UK labour market reality.

---

### 7. GDPR-Proof Data Room Builder

A one-click **“Visa Data Room”** generator:

* Automatically structures folders for business plan, financials, product, legal, and personal docs.
* Includes built-in **GDPR safety checks**, suggesting anonymisation for user data, redaction of sensitive info, and separate “lawyer-only” folders.
  This makes your tool feel like a **compliance-first platform**, not just text generation.

---

### 8. Adversarial Panel Simulator (Mock Endorser Interview)

A mode where the system becomes a **hostile panel** and grills the founder with tough, realistic questions:

* “Your innovation claim is weak because…”
* “Your projections assume X that isn’t evidenced…”
* “Why would this create UK jobs vs outsourcing?”
  Each answer is scored and annotated, producing a **training log** the founder can use to improve before real interviews.

---

### 9. Post-Endorsement Monitoring & Health Dashboard

Instead of stopping at endorsement, your platform offers a **3-year Innovator compliance dashboard**:

* Tracks whether the business is on track with the commitments in the plan (jobs, revenue, milestones).
* Sends reminders: “You said you’d hit X by Month 18 – update your metrics or adjust narrative before next check-in.”
  This turns your site into a **long-term partner**, not just pre-application tool.

---

### 10. Product & Analytics Integration (Real Data → Live Plan)

Your system can connect to **Stripe, PayPal, Google Analytics, Webflow, Bubble, GitHub, etc.**
It then **pulls live metrics** (signups, revenue, active users, deployments) and automatically updates:

* The traction section of the business plan
* Charts in the financial model
* Evidence pack screenshots / tables.
  So plans evolve from **“nice story” → “data-backed, live document”** with minimal manual work.

If you like, next step I can:

* Turn these 10 into **feature cards** for your landing page, or
* Help you pick **3–4 “hero” features** to build first in your MVP (the ones most likely to impress endorsers, lawyers, and users).
