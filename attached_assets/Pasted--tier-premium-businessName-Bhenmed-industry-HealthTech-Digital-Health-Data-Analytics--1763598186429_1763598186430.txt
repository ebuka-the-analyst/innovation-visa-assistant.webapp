expansion
: 
"In the first phase, Bhenmed will focus on a narrow segment: independent clinics and small-group providers in priority UK regions, using direct outreach, founder-led sales and pilot partnerships to prove value. Once we have strong case studies in a few specialties, we will expand across the UK through a land-and-expand approach: growing within existing clinic groups, professional networks and associations.\n\nWe will support this with content marketing (short operational performance insights for clinic managers), partnerships with healthcare IT consultants who can resell or recommend Bhenmed, and integrations with commonly used practice/booking systems to reduce friction. After establishing a solid UK base, we will explore entry into other English-speaking markets with similar clinic structures, starting with targeted partnerships rather than broad mass marketing."
experience
: 
"I have a combined background in IT, data science and digital product development, with several years of hands-on experience building and deploying real-world systems for healthcare, hospitality and e-commerce.\n\nAcademically, I hold a BSc in IT/Business Information Systems and an MSc in Data Science, where I focused on data-driven decision making, predictive analytics and building practical dashboards for operations and performance monitoring. This gives me a strong foundation in databases, data modelling, statistics and Python/SQL-based analytics, which are central to Bhenmed’s data and reporting layer.\n\nProfessionally, I have worked as a data analyst and performance analyst on projects involving NHS-style procurement and operational performance dashboards, waiting time analysis and service utilisation reporting. I have also run my own digital agency, BhenMedia, where I have delivered custom WordPress, API and automation solutions for clients, integrating booking systems, payment gateways and analytics into production environments.\n\nAcross these roles and projects I have:\n\nDesigned and implemented end-to-end data pipelines (from raw data to dashboards).\n\nBuilt AI-assisted and analytics-driven tools that non-technical users can operate.\n\nWorked directly with stakeholders (managers, clinicians, and operational staff) to translate real business problems into technical solutions.\n\nThis combination of technical skills (data, software, AI) and practical delivery experience in UK service environments is directly relevant to building, validating and scaling Bhenmed as an operational performance and analytics platform for healthcare providers."

problem
: 
"Bhenmed tackles the problem of fragmented, manual and outdated systems used by small and mid-sized healthcare providers. Many clinics, GP practices and allied health professionals still rely on a mix of paper records, spreadsheets and disconnected tools, which makes it hard to track patient journeys, reduce waiting times and use data to improve care.\n\nBecause existing enterprise healthcare software is expensive, complex and designed for large hospitals, smaller providers are often left without a practical digital option. This leads to lost information, duplicated work, slower decisions and poor visibility of performance. Bhenmed solves this by giving clinics an affordable, integrated platform that combines digital workflows, patient engagement and real-time operational analytics in one place."
revenue
: 
"Bhenmed will operate as a subscription-based SaaS platform for small and mid-sized healthcare providers.\n\n\nCore subscription (per clinic / per month):\nTiered pricing based on number of clinicians and locations (e.g. Solo, Small Clinic, Multi-site). This covers access to the platform, analytics dashboards and standard integrations.\n\n\nOnboarding & configuration fees:\nOne-time setup fee for data migration, initial template configuration and staff training, keeping implementation light and affordable compared to enterprise systems.\n\n\nPremium analytics & automation add-ons:\nOptional advanced modules (e.g. predictive capacity planning, cancellation/no-show prediction, custom reports, extra integrations) charged as add-ons per month.\n\n\nAdvisory & performance improvement packages:\nFor clinics that want deeper support, Bhenmed can provide data-driven performance reviews and optimisation workshops on a project or retainer basis.\n\n\nOver time, as we build a network of clinics on the platform, we can also introduce multi-site and group-level licences, creating recurring revenue with strong retention as Bhenmed becomes embedded in their daily operations.\n"
technology
: 
"Bhenmed combines three elements that are usually separated:\n\nData integration & cleaning layer – connectors to common clinic tools (practice systems, booking tools, spreadsheets) with an automated data quality layer that standardises fields and flags issues before they affect reporting.\n\nAI-assisted analytics & workflows – an embedded AI engine that helps managers ask natural-language questions (“Why are Tuesday evening appointments overbooked?”), generates on-the-fly reports, and suggests optimisation actions (e.g. session reshuffling, template schedules, recall lists).\n\nNo-code operational playbooks – drag-and-drop “playbooks” where clinics can turn analytics into repeatable actions (e.g. auto-building call lists, sending reminders, creating tasks) without needing a developer.\n\nThis combination of data quality, AI insight and no-code automation, targeted specifically at smaller healthcare providers in the UK, is what makes Bhenmed’s approach different from generic dashboards or heavy enterprise hospital systems."

uniqueness
: 
"Most healthcare software is built for large hospitals, with long implementations, rigid workflows and high licence fees. Bhenmed is designed specifically for small and mid-sized clinics, GP practices and allied health providers who need something lighter, faster and more affordable.\n\nInstead of trying to replace every system, Bhenmed focuses on operational performance – waiting times, utilisation, cancellations, no-shows, referral bottlenecks – and turns this into simple dashboards and automations that non-technical staff can actually use. The platform comes with pre-built UK healthcare templates (for common pathways and KPIs), self-service configuration instead of expensive consultants, and a pricing model that works for single-site and multi-site providers. This makes Bhenmed feel more like a “plug-and-play operations brain” than a traditional EHR or practice management system."
vision
: 
"Over the next 5 years, my goal is to establish Bhenmed as a recognised operational performance platform for small and mid-sized healthcare providers in the UK, with a stable base of recurring SaaS revenue and a growing network of clinics that rely on the product for daily decision-making.\n\nBy year 5, I aim for Bhenmed to:\n• Serve hundreds of clinic sites on subscription, across multiple specialties and regions.\n• Offer a mature library of pre-built pathway and KPI templates for different types of clinics.\n• Provide advanced AI-driven recommendations that automatically suggest scheduling changes, resource allocation and follow-up actions to improve waiting times and utilisation.\n• Support a skilled UK-based team covering product, engineering, data, customer success and commercial functions.\n\nLonger term, the technology and playbooks developed for healthcare can be adapted to other regulated service sectors, allowing Bhenmed to become a broader platform for data-driven operational improvement beyond healthcare while retaining a strong UK base."
